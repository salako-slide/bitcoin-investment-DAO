# Technical Specification

## Overview

The Bitcoin Investment DAO smart contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization for collective Bitcoin investment management on the Stacks blockchain.

## Contract Architecture

### Data Structures

1. **Members Map**

```clarity
{
    staked-amount: uint,
    last-reward-block: uint,
    rewards-claimed: uint
}
```

2. **Proposals Map**

```clarity
{
    proposer: principal,
    title: (string-ascii 100),
    description: (string-ascii 500),
    amount: uint,
    recipient: principal,
    start-block: uint,
    end-block: uint,
    yes-votes: uint,
    no-votes: uint,
    status: (string-ascii 20),
    executed: bool
}
```

3. **Votes Map**

```clarity
{
    proposal-id: uint,
    voter: principal
} -> {
    vote: bool
}
```

### Governance Parameters

- `dao-owner`: Principal address of DAO owner
- `total-staked`: Total STX tokens staked
- `proposal-count`: Total number of proposals
- `quorum-threshold`: Required voting threshold (500 = 50%)
- `proposal-duration`: Voting period in blocks (144 = ~24 hours)
- `min-proposal-amount`: Minimum stake required for proposals

## Core Functions

### Administrative

- `initialize`: Set DAO owner
- `is-dao-owner`: Check owner status
- `is-member`: Verify membership

### Membership Management

- `stake-tokens`: Join DAO by staking
- `unstake-tokens`: Withdraw stake
- `calculate-voting-power`: Determine voting weight

### Proposal System

- `create-proposal`: Submit new proposal
- `vote`: Cast vote on proposal
- `execute-proposal`: Process approved proposal
- `get-proposal-status`: Check proposal state

### Read-Only Functions

- `get-member-info`: View member details
- `get-proposal-info`: View proposal details
- `get-vote-info`: Check vote status
- `get-dao-info`: View DAO parameters

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**

   - Owner permissions
   - Member validation
   - Proposal restrictions

2. **Treasury Protection**

   - Quorum requirements
   - Time-locked execution
   - Amount validation

3. **Input Validation**

   - String length checks
   - Amount verification
   - Principal validation

4. **State Management**
   - Atomic operations
   - Status tracking
   - Balance verification

## Error Codes

- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED` (u100): Permission denied
- `ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT` (u101): Invalid token amount
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND` (u102): Proposal doesn't exist
- `ERR-ALREADY-VOTED` (u103): Duplicate vote
- `ERR-PROPOSAL-EXPIRED` (u104): Past voting period
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE` (u105): Inadequate funds
- Additional error codes documented in contract

## Implementation Notes

1. **Staking Mechanism**

   - Direct STX token staking
   - Proportional voting power
   - Protected unstaking process

2. **Proposal Lifecycle**

   - Creation with validation
   - Active voting period
   - Execution or rejection
   - Status tracking

3. **Voting System**

   - Stake-weighted votes
   - Single vote per proposal
   - Quorum calculation
   - Time-bound voting

4. **Treasury Management**
   - Protected transfers
   - Quorum requirements
   - Execution validation
